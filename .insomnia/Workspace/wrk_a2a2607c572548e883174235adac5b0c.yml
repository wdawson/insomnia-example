name: USPTO Data Set API 1.0.0
description: The Data Set API (DSAPI) allows the public users to discover and
  search USPTO exported data sets. This is a generic API that allows USPTO users
  to make any CSV based data files searchable through API. With the help of GET
  call, it returns the list of data fields that are searchable. With the help of
  POST call, data can be fetched based on the filters on the field names. Please
  note that POST call is used to search the actual data. The reason for the POST
  call is that it allows users to specify any complex search criteria without
  worry about the GET size limitations as well as encoding of the input
  parameters.
